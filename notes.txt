writing a script to download images on Imgur - three versions:
    - one is sequential (one download at a time)
    - one is concurrent (one thread switching around often at I/O time, 'fake parallelism')
    - one is parallel (multiple threads; 'true parallelism')


we'll have a module 'utils.py' which will help us in fetching images. we'll need a way to:
    - get links to random images
    - download image from a link
    - save image to some directory
