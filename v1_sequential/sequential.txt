sequentially - one at a time

we'll make a GET request and wait for it to come back (download an image and wait for it to come back)

this can be really slow - especially for large volumes of images, or really large images

it would be good if while we're waiting for something to be done, we can begin a new task

therefore we will be introducing concurrency and parallelism solutions
